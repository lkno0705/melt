/**
 * This class is used to finetune a transformer model based on a generated dataset.
 * It comes in two fashions. First, it can be used to generate a fine-tuned model with every call of the match method.
 * The input alignment of the match method is used to generate a training dataset.
 * Thus, the input alignment should contain positive correspondences (with an equivalence relation) and negative
 * correspondences (with another relation than equivalence).
 * 
 * As a second fashion, this matcher can be used to only generate the training file (by possibly multiple calls to the match method).
 * Thus, within the match method only the training file is written. After all calls to the match method, one can call
 * the {@link #finetuneModel() } function to train the model on the whole dataset.
 * 
 * In both cases, the fine-tuned model as well as the tokenizer is written to the specified directory.
